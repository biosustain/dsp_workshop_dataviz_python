# PXD040621

Data was processed with quantms in the proteomics introduction course. We will use
the protein tables quantified using directlfq and a simpler median based approach.

  broccoli-derived antioxidant sulforaphane in human gut - 
  [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464623002451)

This dataset contains the proteome profiling of a escherichia coli strain named
EPEC E2349/69 which showed the biggest growth response to an broccoli-derived antioxidant
called sulforaphane, which can be administered orally.

Four of them are treated with 10 μM sulforaphane. The aim is to compare the proteome between
both conditions.

Goals:
 - identify the impact of sulforaphane on the human gut microbiome (in anaerobic conditions
   of the gut)

## Context

This data is part of a bigger collection of E. coli projects. Thanks
to Caroline Jachmann for the great work assembling a peptide atlas with post translational
modifications for ecoli:
