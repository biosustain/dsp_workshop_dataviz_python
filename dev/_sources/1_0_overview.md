# Overview

## Static Plots

Can be best created using [`matplotlib`](1_1_matplotlib.ipynb) and 
[`seaborn`](1_2_seaborn.ipynb) which is itself based on matplotlib.

- good for publications and presentations
- see slides for hints

## Interactive Plots

Can be best created using [`plotly`](2_plotly.ipynb) and 
[`vuecore`](3_vuecore.ipynb) which is itself based on plotly at the moment.

- good for dashboards and interactive data exploration
