# Instructions

The general idea is that you have some data set upto to 
recreate a figure from a paper - and you can try changing it 
to your liking.

One solution is given (hidden) at the end, but this will 
help any LLM to prompt you with hints if you get stuck.

Try to manipulate the plot as much as you like.

Every exercise can be opened in colab using the launch button on the top right: 🚀
